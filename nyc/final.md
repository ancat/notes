- Owned a piano company, moved from Germany to Astoria in 1870

### Steinway Commission/Rapid Transit Commission

    - High price scared away any potential bidders

## Rapid Transit Act of 1894

- Due to lack of subway progress, NYC Chamber of Commerce proposed a new Rapid Transit Commission
    - Incorporated some of Hewitt's public financing plans
    - 5 out of 8 seats would be controlled by the Chamber
    - (1894) Signed into law by the Governor
- Caveats
    - Public referendum had to be held regarding the proposal
        - Passed overwhelmingly
    - Total cost was limited to 50 million dollars
    - Plans had to be reviewed and approved by the Mayor, board of Aldermen
    
### Milestones

- Called for single subway line running along the Steinway Commission's main route
    - Defeated by propety owners
- Steinway proposed a scaled down single subway running from City Hall to Grand Central
    - (1898) Plan and all other requests were approved

## New Subway

- (1898) the RTC received two bids for construction
    - Andrew Onderdonk
        - 39.9 million from the city
        - promised above 5 million a year in profit
    - John B. McDonald 
        - flat 35 million from the city
        - No share of operating profits 
        
## Contract 1

- Awarded to John B. McDonald
- Financier: August Belmont
    - Agreed to finance the 7 million needed to begin construction
    - Signed the contract with McDonald
- Chief Engineer: William Parsons
    - Principal architect of the final subway plan
    - Supervised McDonald
    
## Contract 2

- George Gould opposed any subway expansion: crowded trains meant more profit
- Belmont responded to Gould's Manhattan Railway by buying all properties that Manhattan Railway required
- BRT submitted a bid on Contract 2, but Belmont submitted a lowball bid to maintain subway monopoly

### Construction Issues

- Manhattan's Uneven Terrain
    - Efficient operation required smooth land
    - Meant construction had to tunnel through deep bedrock
- Harlem River
    - Plan required tunneling through the river
    - Done by pre-fabricating iron rings and then sinking them into the water
- Cut and cover
    - Cut and cover tunneling required moving utilities under the street
    - Temporary street coverings needed to keep trolley lines and other transportation in action during construction
- Worker pay
    - Unskilled workers earned at most 2.25, skilled got 2.50, and miners got 3.75 because it was so risky. 
    - Most workers were Irish or Italian immigrants
- Many deaths
    - 54 workers were killed during the construction of the IRT.

            - Rapid transit lines should precede population, not follow it
            - Prospective passengers should not need to walk more than half a mile to reach a rapid transit station
            - All transit lines should traverse the center and be just as accessible
            - The rapid transit plan should form the basis for the city plan
            - Profit and costs were secondary to the indirect profit gained by the city from use of the rapid transit systems
