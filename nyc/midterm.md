- Most of Western half of NY destroyed

# Enabling Technologies
## Tunneling
- Needed to dig pathways for underground travel
- Techniques:
    - Cut grooves to create fault lines; fill with wood, pour water; wood expands and cracks the rock
    - Fire Quenching: Heat rocks with fire, and then quench with cold water; dangerous and usually done by slaves
    - Cut and cover: Used for shallow tunnels; trench is excavated, roofed over, and then covered back over

### Marc Brunel
- (1843 opened) Built a tunnel under Thames River, known as Thames Tunnel
- Patented tunneling shield to make underwater tunneling safer

### Peter Barlow, James Greathead
- Modified Brunel's design, used it to built Tower Tunnel in a little over a year

## Steam Engine
### Thomas Savery (Steam Fire Engine)
- Designed to pump water out of coal mines
- Relied on heating and cooling water to open and close valves
    - Problematic because this was time consuming and costly

### Thomas Newcomen (Atmospheric Engine)
- First steam device deemed "appropriate" for industrial use; used to pump water out of mines
- Used pistons controlled by steam to open and close valves

### James Watt (Condensing Steam Engine)
- Decided Newcomen's engine was inefficient (it still had to continually heat and cool water)
- Separated heating and cooling chambers while insulating heating chamber
    - Partnered with Matthew Boulton to fund the project

### Key Problems
- Savery's engines experienced several deadly explosions
- Watt patented a high-pressure steam engine but was still afraid of deadly explosions

### Richard Trevithick (First successful Steam Engine)
- (1804) Built t haul 10 tons of materials along a 10 mile rail system in a coal mine
- Ran successfully for several years without problem
- Eventually had a high-pressure explosion, stalling commercial success

### George Stephenson ("Rocket")
- (1829) First commercially viable steam engine
- Used tubular boilers and pistons to control two drive wheels in the front of the engine
- Started the "age of steam engines" in 1830s

## Electricity
### Thomas A. Edison
- Began the age of usable and practical electricity
- Established first "mass-production" facility dedicated to invention and innovation
- Invented phonograph and improved lightbulb
- Developed a system to deliver electricity so people could use his products
    - Relied on direct current (DC)
    - Formed "Edison Electric Co", funded by JP Morgan and Vanderbilts
    - Generating facility at Pearl Street, could not deliver electricity too far due to DC limitations
        - **Nikola Tesla**, funded by George Westinghouse, developed Alternating Current (AC)
            - Could be transmitted further distances, so it eventually was adopted for mass distribution

## Electric Traction Motor
### Thomas Davenport
- (1835) Built model railway operated by small electric motor

### Robert Davidson
- (1838) Developed electric engine reaching 4mph

### Farmer
- (1847) Operated a small electric car for two people (lol??)

### Page
- (1851) Built small electrically powered road car reaching 19mph

### Issues
- All of these traction motors used electric storage batteries with limited range and high recharge times
- **Dynamo** invented by **Pacinette, Siemens, Farmer**
    - Made electric traction more practical

### Frank Sprague
- (1884) Formed **Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company**
    - Invented constant-speed non-sparking traction motor
- Installed the first trolley system in the world in Richmond, Virginia
- Over 100 electric railways were planning on using Sprague's equipment
- Edison bought out Sprague's traction motor plant
- (1892) Sprague formed the **Sprague Electric Elevator Company**
    - Developed elevators with floor control, acceleration, etc
    - Eventually sold out to Otis Elevator

### Conclusion
- In the 1800s, everything needed for steam powered railways was in place
- By the 1900s, everything would be in place for electric-traction powered rail transit

# Public Transit
- Population expanding, but everyone stuck in Lower Manhattan (below modern day Canal Street)
- Expansion towards north restricted by terrain/distance; expansion towards west restricted by water

## Horse-Drawn Car (Stagecoach)
- First form of public transit
- Originally used as a way to deliver mail to the West
    - Dangerous way to travel; stagecoaches carried lots of gold/silver/etc and were robbed
- Eventually railroad took over east-west mail/passenger market
    - Stagecoaches were still around to take people where railroads did not reach
- Note: This was public transportation between cities, NOT within cities

## Omnibus (Horse-drawn carriage)
- Fixed-route horse-drawn carriage
- Credited to **Stanislas Baudry** who ran a similar service in Nantes, France to bring people from town to his public bath houses
- (1827) First introduced in New York by **Adam Brower**
    - Serviced along Broadway up to Bleeker Street
    - Designed two carriages, "The Accommodation" and "The Sociable"
    - Service became very popular, eventually extended to Bond Street with more coaches added
- Minimal regulation; passengers could not be picked up or dropped off on city streets
    - Stage Carriage Act: Required drivers and conductors be licensed (with licensing fees of course)
- (1835) Over 100 companies and individuals operating omnibuses
    - Fierce competition with lots of fighting and fare cheating

## Street Railway/Streetcars
- Horse-drawn carriages that operated with wheels on a rail
- (1832) **John Mason** organized *New York and Harlem Rail Company* to build terminus for first passenger railroad service
    - Obtained state charter to build single/double track railways from Harlem River to 23rd street
    - Council also approved a 4th avenue route with an extension along Broadway and the Bowery to Walker Street
- Advantages over Omnbus:
    - Smoother ride (streets were bumpy; wheels on rails avoided the bumpy street)
    - Much faster (riding on rails minimized friction, went from 4mph to 8mph)
    - Higher capacity
- (1854) Service was so popular it was initiated in Brooklyn
- Although this was very popular, it did not solve New York's expansion problem
    - Streetcars did push northern boundary from Houston St. to 42nd street
        - A small development but still 2x the expansion done in the last 200 years

## Trolleys
- Considered to be the bridging technology between horse-drawn streetcars and buses
- First successfully operated in Montgomery, Alabama by **James Gaboury and Charles Depoele**
    - Demonstrated a small electric vehicle moving back and forth on a track powered by a thin overhead wire
- Edison built a small electric railroad in Menlo Park; eventually taken over by **Frank Sprague**
    - Sprague, with Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company, electrified the Union Passenger Railway of Richmond, Virginia
- Were powered in one of three major sources: Trolley Pole (overhead wire for electricity), Battery Packs, or Center Power Slot, Third Rail

###  City Control
- Government had the right to collect taxes and fees from private operators for using public streets to make profit
- City issued "franchises" for specific routes, collecting fees and taxes based on individual contracts
- **Cantor Act** allowed franchises to bid on the percentage of taxes to be paid

### Trolleys in Manhattan and The Bronx
- (1888) Major blizzard hit NY, damaging electric and telephone lines
    - All utilities had to be moved underground, including trolley wires
- (1886) **Metropolitan Traction Company** incorporated by Philadelphian investors
    - Buys up individual streetcar operations one by one
    - (1897) MTC dissolves, and is now known as **Metropolitan Street Railway**
        - Still can't pay off leases or dividends to investors, goes bankrupt; eventually acquired and renamed to **New York City Railway Company**
- **Metropolitan Traction Company** -> buys up streetcar operations -> dissolves -> **Metropolitan Street Railway** -> can't pay off debts -> acquired & renamed -> **New York City Railway Company**

### Trolleys in Brooklyn and Queens
- (1887) First electrified trolley in NYC ran along Jamaica Avenue
- Both Brooklyn and Queens had trolley systems before Manhattan
    - Run better and longer than the ones in Manhattan, but faced the same corporate instability
- Three major corporations: **Brooklyn Railroad, Atlantic Avenue Railroad, and Coney Island Brooklyn Railroad**.
- (1894) **Long Island Traction Company** reorganizes itself as the **Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company** (BRT)
    - By 1900, it has already acquired almost all elevated lines and trolley lines in Brooklyn
- (1918) BRT goes bankrupt, and emerges from receivership as **Brooklyn Manhattan Transit Company** (BMT)
- **Long Island Traction Company** -> buys up as many elevateds and trolleys it can -> reorganized as **Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company** -> bankrupt, emerges as -> **Brooklyn Manhattan Transit Company**

# Elevateds
## Dangers in the city
- Traffic at an all time high, crossing major streets proved to be unsafe
- Streetcars and Omnibuses had lots of waste
    - over 10 pounds of poop and countless gallons of urine dumped on the street every day
    - (1872) A virus epidemic killed and hurt thousands of horses, crippling public transportation

## New Ideas
- Key Issues: Power Source?
    - Small Steam Engines
    - Cable Systems with Stationary Steam Engines
    - Pneumatic or Atmospheric Power
- Key Issues: Where do the trains go?
    - Above the street?
    - Above the sidewalk?
    - On the street?
    - Below the street?

### Hugh B. Wilson's Subway Plan (1864)
- Incorporated **Metropolitan Railway Company** and petitioned to build subway from Battery to Central Park under Broadway
    - Received 5 million in funding from John Jacob Astor
    - Worked with engineer A.P. Robinson to improve plans
        - Wanted to use an "inverted" cut-and-cover construction method
    - Lots of drama ensued, proposal eventually failed

### Charles Harvey and the 9th Avenue Elevated
- Got legislative approval to build a .25 mile test system between Battery and Morris Street; Eventually approved to complete the rest of the line
- Incorporated the **West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway**
- Got fired from his company for disagreeing with the fact his investors wanted to manipulate the stock for profit
    - New owners of the West Side Yonkers Patent Railway rename it into **New York Elevated Railway** and begin testing steam engines
- **Viaduct Plan** included significant opposition to these steam engines from people such as homeowners across the line and businesses
    - Boss Tweed had just been indicted, Viaduct Plan was defeated
        - Allowed New York Elevated Railway to install steam-powered service and expand successfully

### Dr. Rufus Gilbert and the 6th Avenue Elevated
- Believed the root cause of illness and death common in the tenements was due to their being tightly packed with people at all times
    - He was convinced the solution to this involved rapid transit to disperse people
    - Joined the NJ Central Railroad company but eventually left to work for rapid transit in NYC
- Gilbert's plan involved an elevated pneumatic system but was convinced by his business partner, Foster, into switching to steam propulsion to attract support

### Rapid Transit Commission
- Created by **Abram Hewitt**, former mayor and opponent of Tammany Hall
- Owned publicly by NYC, used to determine needs of the city, routes for trains, and companies that would build them
- Decisions:
    - New York Elevated would build a loop from the Battery to South Ferry
    - Gilbert elevated would build elevated lines on 6th and 2nd avenues
    - New York Elevated would build an elevated line on 3rd avenue connected to grand central on 42nd street
    - **Manhattan Railway Company** created by the RTC as backup in case Gilbert or NYE goes bankrupt
        - Right after opening day, Gilbert is voted out of his company and it is renamed to **Metropolitan Elevated Company**

### Jay Gould Hijacks the Elevateds
- Gould controlled a major newspaper, and had influence over several judges and legislators
    - Wrote fake stories indicating Manhattan Railway was insolvent and corrupt
        - Prices tanked, Gould bought as many as he could
        - Had sufficient shares to control Manhattan Railway and all of its elevateds

### Elevateds grow in Brooklyn
- Coney Island begins to attract rich people, which inspired development of hotels, amusement parks, etc
- (1883) Brooklyn Bridge opens, but couldn't support steam engines
    - Instead, a cable car service across the bridge was operated by the **New York Brooklyn Bridge Railway Co**. Service was provided even after electrification of the Brooklyn elevateds

#### The Lexington Avenue El ("The Old Main Line")
- (1885) First Brooklyn Elevated opens, built and operated by Brooklyn Elevated Railroad

#### The Myrtle Avenue El
- (1888) Built by **Union Elevated**, but leased to **Brooklyn Elevated** for operation.

#### The Broadway El
- (1888) Built by Union Elevated, but leased to **Brooklyn Elevated**

#### Fifth Avenue El
- (1888) Built by Union Elevated and leased to **Brooklyn Elevated**

#### Fulton Street El
- (1888) Built and operated by the **Kings County Elevated Railway Company**

### Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT)
- By 1900, it had already acquired all street railroads, Coney Island Railroads, and elevateds

## ELectrification (haha get it? ELs and ELectrified?)
- (1895) Frank Sprague had developed his electric traction motor and multiple unit operation
- (1898) Electrification began in Brooklyn, with the BRT adopting multiple-unit electric traction power
- (1902) Second Avenue El electrified
- (1902) Third Avenue El electrified
- (1902) Sixth Avenue El electrified
- (1903) Ninth Avenue El electrified

## Major Impact of the Elevateds
- Pushed northern expansion to all parts of Manhattan and the Bronx
- Pushed western expansion into Brooklyn, and eventually Queens

# First Two Contracts
## John McDonald
- had the winning bid for the project
- organized the RTC
- needed a 7million deposit before starting work

## August Belmont
- provided funding for the project
Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT)
- company founded by McDonald and Belmont
- the operating company for the first contract
- opened in 1904

## William Barclay Parsons
- chief engineer for RTC
- asked by Belmont to join IRT

# Dual Contracts
## Two New Rules
- The Public Service Commission (PSC) is now replacing the RTC and is in charge of making transit decisions
- The Elsberg Act limits leases to private transit operators to 20 years and allows a buyout after 10 years

## Moving from private to public operation
- Elevateds: publicly awarded, private construction and operation
- IRT: Publicly financed; private operation
- Dual Contracts (IRT Expansion, BMT): Cooperative public/private partnership for construction and operation
- Independent (IND): Public construction and operation; no private participation

## First Attempt: The Triborough Plan
- This plan only serviced areas that were already developed
    - Attempted to avoid unpopulated areas, to attract bidders
    - Done even though PSC aimed to open new areas to development
- Planned by **William Randolph Hearst** who felt Belmont as corrupt and wanted a monopoly
    - All construction and operation would be done by the city

### William Gaynor
- Mayor of NYC at one point
    - Believed Hearst in that city funded projects should belong to the city, but that the Triborough Plan was flawed
        - It would require increasing the fare 2x
        - It would require an incredibly large initial investment

### George McAneny
- Borough president of Manhattan
- Put in charge of a Transit Committee
    - Worked with George Cromwell (Borough President of Richmond)
    - Worked with Cyrus Miller (Borough President of The Bronx)
- Tasked to come up with a new plan for rapid transit expansion
- Agreed to work with IRT and BRT
    - Theodore Shonts (President of IRT) convinced Gaynor that IRT was not corrupt and should be working with the city
    - Timothy S Williams (President of BRT) convinced McAneny to divide lines between IRT and BRT in such a way that repetition would be avoided
- IRT agreed to convert the Steinway Tunnel to rapid transit and extend the elevateds to Astoria and Woodside
- BRT added a Manhattan trunk line from the Battery to Central Park South

## Conclusion
- The Dual Contract System (Contract 3 to IRT and Contract 4 to BRT) expanded the system from 296 track-miles to 619 track-miles
- Greatly advanced cross-borough travel (except for Staten Island)
- HUEG population shift between 1910 and 1940
    - Manhattan dropped 19%
        - Manhattan had actually peaked in population in 1910, it's never been higher since
    - Bronx went up 309%
    - Brooklyn went up 165%
    - Queens went up 209%
- Dual Contract lines pushed development towards Brooklyn, Queens, and fueled further expansion in the Bronx

# Issues Later On
## Malbone Street Wreck
- Edward Luciano receives 2 hours of conductor training (usually it's like 2 weeks)
    - While sick and being forced to run a train on an unfamiliar line, e begins to drive too fast
    - Speed limit is 6mph, Luciano is driving at 30mph
    - Some trains derail, some crash, around 100 people died

## Bankruptcy of the BRT
- (1918) BRT filed for bankruptcy and goes into receivership
    - Unrelated to the Malbone Street Accident
- (1923) BRT reorganized into the Brooklyn Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT)
